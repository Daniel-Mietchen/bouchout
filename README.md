# Implementing the Bouchout Declaration
The [Bouchout Declaration](http://bouchoutdeclaration.org/) was launched to bring the biodiversity research community together around the values of sharing research openly. It lays out a number of principles on how to do that, and it has been signed by a good number of institutions and individuals around the globe.

This repo is to help with the planning of follow-up activities that focus on supporting the implementation of the Bouchout principles as well as on monitoring progress.
